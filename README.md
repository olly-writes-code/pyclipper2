# pyclipper2

Python bindings for [Clipper2](https://github.com/AngusJohnson/Clipper2/tree/main)

### Why does this exists?
Clipper2 is now alive and kicking. It should be preferred vs the old Clipper library (see docs [here](https://www.angusj.com/clipper2/Docs/Overview.htm)).

While one could leverage [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for some 2D line and shape operations, it's API and performance is limited.
